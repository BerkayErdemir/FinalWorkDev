## Bug reporting

I encourage people to report bugs. Before you report a bug, first read these steps: 1) do as thorough a search as you can to see whether the bug has already been reported, and 2) be as precise and complete as you can when reporting a new bug.

To report a bug:

1. Go to the project.

2. Click the Issues button on the left of the window.

3. Click the "New issue" button.

4. Fill out the Title and Description. You don't need to fill out the other fields.
